# React Redux Starter

My take on a starter on an opinionated React Redux boilerplate and file orginization

### Technologies used

* Redux/React Redux
* React Router Dom
* Axios
* Redux Thunk
* Redux Logger
* Node Sass/SCSS

### Installation

Everything works out of the box. 
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you prefer other styling methods:

```
yarn remove node-sass
```
